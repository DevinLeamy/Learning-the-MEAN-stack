# Learning-the-MEAN-stack
Projects I've made on my path to MEAN stack expertise. <br/> 
*<< Note: I have not added all projects files, I have only added those most pertinent. >>* <br/> <br/>
***Login Page App*** <br/>
A login page app that utilizes salted-hashes, JSON Web Tokens, a simple API and session storage in order to keep a private page secure. <br/>
***Short Polling App*** <br/>
A simple messenger that uses short-polling/AJAX requests to update across clients in seconds. <br/>
***Long Polling App*** <br/>
Inlight of the load that short-polling/AJAX requests has on a server, I modified the messenger I developed to use a <br/>
more scalable technologie for sending and receiving messages, websockets. I settled up on socket.io, an easy-to-use <br/>
socket technology that can be added to express without too much hastle. Socket.io allows for real-time updates <br/>
without the bruden of sending requests periodically, making them appear to implement a *long-polling* esk procedure, <br/>
which is great. <br/>

***Group Messaging App*** <br/>
Using the primative message I developed for the Long Polling App as a baseline, I developed a messenger the allows <br/>
for messaging among discrete groups of clients.
